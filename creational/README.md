### Abstract Factory 
The abstract factory, groups object factories that have a common theme, without specifying their concrete classes.

It helps solves problems like:
* How can an application be independant of how its objects are created?
* How can a class be independent of how the objects it requires are created?
* How can families of related or dependent objects be created?
